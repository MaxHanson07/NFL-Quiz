# Instructions

User clicks "start quiz" button.

The program will ask several questions about how long the user wants the password to be and what type of characters the user wants the password to consist of.

These answers are validated to ensure that the password length is a number, the length is between 7 and 129 characters, and that the user chooses at least one type of character to build the password with.

The program randomly selects the specified amount of characters from the desired character types and displays the user's password on the webpage. 

The process will repeat with every click of the "generate password" button.
